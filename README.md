<h1>Repeated Even Numbers Finder</h1>

  <h2>Program Description</h2>
  <p>This Java program finds the repeated even numbers in an integer array.</p>

  <h2>Program Usage</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Update the <code>numbers</code> array in the <code>Main</code> class with your desired integer values.</li>
    <li>Compile and run the program using a Java compiler or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.</li>
    <li>The program will output the repeated even numbers along with their frequencies.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>Given the following array: <code>int[] numbers = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 2, 4, 12, 4, 6, 5, 51, 14, 14, 16, 18, 20}</code></p>
  <p>The program will output:</p>
  <pre>
Repeated Even Numbers:
2 (Frequency: 2)
4 (Frequency: 3)
6 (Frequency: 2)
14 (Frequency: 2)
  </pre>
  <p>In this example, the numbers 2, 4, 6, and 14 are the repeated even numbers, and the frequencies of each number are shown in parentheses.</p>
